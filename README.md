# Malaria-Detection-system
#### System is composed of Deep Residual network used to classify the red blood cells  as Infected or Uninfected.

#### In Blood smears method to test malaria, Clinicians have to examine blood samples under the microscope and manually count infected red blood cells.

### Uninfected red blood cell:

### Infected red blood cell:

#### According to the official WHO malaria parasite counting protocol, a clinician may have to manually count up to 5,000 cells, an extremely tedious and time-consuming process.

#### Malaria detection system is trained on deep Residual network to recognize Infected and Uninfected red blood cell, System achieved 97% validation accuracy
